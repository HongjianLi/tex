Dear Editor,

We are submitting a paper entitled "In silico Identification and in vitro and in vivo Validation of Anti-Psychotic Drug Fluspirilene as a Potential CDK2 Inhibitor and a Candidate Anti-Cancer Drug" for your consideration as an original research article.

Our paper presents a successful prospective application of our free and open-source protein-ligand docking software, idock, in identifying CDK2 inhibitors from FDA-approved small molecule drugs using a repurposing strategy and an ensemble docking methodology. We showed that fluspirilene, currently used for the therapy of chronic schizophrenia, exhibited anti-cancer effect in human hepatoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells. We demonstrated for the first time that oral fluspirilene treatment significantly and dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in vivo in BALB/C nude mice subcutaneously xenografted with human hepatocellular carcinoma. Most importantly, the combinatorial therapy of fluspirilene and the leading cancer drug fluorouracil exhibited even higher therapeutic effect. These results suggested for the first time that fluspirilene is a potential CDK2 inhibitor and a candidate anti-cancer drug for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma.

We hope you will be as excited as we are about this new discovery. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further information.

Yours Sincerely,

Hongjian Li, on behalf of the co-authors.
