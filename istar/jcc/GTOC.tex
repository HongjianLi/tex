We are motivated to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our docking engine idock and thus have developed a novel web platform called istar. Without tedious software installation, users can submit jobs on the fly either by browsing our web site or by programming against our RESTful API. Our HTML5- and CSS3-powered istar web site supports several unique and pragmatic features that cannot be found on other online docking platforms.
