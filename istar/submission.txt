Cover letter
We develop a web platform called istar to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our fast docking engine idock and our accurate scoring function RF-Score. It can provide the best docking conformations for a particular protein target out of more than 12 million ligands. Users can easily customize the search space for the target and select which ligands to dock. Results directly provide where to buy compounds for wet-lab test. Our web platform is very pragmatic and much easier to use than DOCK Blaster. We believe many colleagues will be using it in the future. It is available at http://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk
