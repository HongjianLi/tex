\section{Summary:}
We were motivated by the desire to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our idock and thus developed istar, a general SaaS (Software as a Service) platform. Without tedious software installation, users, especially computational chemists, can submit jobs on the fly either by browsing our web site or by programming against our RESTful API. Our HTML5- and CSS3-powered web site supports filtering and previewing ligands to dock, as well as monitoring job progress in real time, two very useful features commonly lacked in other SaaS platforms like DOCK Blaster. We developed a customized daemon from idock 1.5 and implemented two-phase docking. We deployed several high-performance workstations to run the idock daemon in the background and exploited fine-grained slice-level parallelism in phase 1. The daemon compresses result files using gzip to save server storage and network bandwidth.

\section{Introduction}

In 2011, we developed idock 1.0 \citep{1153}, a multithreaded virtual screening tool for flexible ligand docking. In 2012, we developed idock 1.5, further improving docking speed and accuracy, inventing new functionalities, and fixing bugs. Comprehensive benchmark showed that idock 1.5 displayed comparable success rates in terms of redocking but significantly outperformed state-of-the-art AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 \citep{595} in terms of docking speed by at least 8.69 times and at most 37.51 times across 12 diverse receptors and 3000 ligands of different molecular weight.

Having released idock, we kept receiving docking requirements from our colleagues and collaborators. They are mostly biochemists and pharmacists, outsourcing the docking research to us after discovering potential biological targets for certain diseases of therapeutic interest. All of a sudden, we had to grab the protein structure, do format conversion, define search space, set up docking parameters, and keep running idock in batch for months. Tedious enough, all the above work was done manually, resulting in very low research productivity. In order to boost efficiency and automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our idock, we therefore developed istar, a general SaaS platform.

Figure \ref{istar:architecture} shows the architecture of istar. There are five major components: a web site, a web server, a database management system, several workstations, and a network file system. Under typical circumstance, a user browses our web site and submits a job. The web server first validates user input and then saves it into database. Several workstations run daemons in the background, fetching jobs from the database and carrying out experiments. Upon completion, they send a completion notification email to the user and write the result to a network file system, which is served as static content by the web server. The user again browses our web site to download result or monitor progress.

On the client side, we seamlessly combined both the Twitter Bootstrap and the HTML5 Boilerplate into a HTML5- and CSS3-powered web site, which was successfully checked as HTML5 by the W3C Markup Validator v1.3. We adopted the jQuery library to simplify HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions, and the jQuery UI library to provide themeable widgets. We tested our web site with Chrome 19+, Firefox 12+, Internet Explorer 9+, Safari 5+ and Opera 12+.

On the server side, we built the web server in the same JavaScript language using the well-known asynchronous event-driven node.js on top of the express server, forking multiple worker processes to accept simultaneous HTTP/SPDY connections. We utilized the spdy node module to support SPDY protocol v3, the prototype of next generation HTTP 2.0, achieving reduced latency through compression, multiplexing, and prioritization. We employed the forever node module to restart worker processes automatically in case of unhandled exceptions, ensuring failover and high availability. We made heavy use of regular expressions and developed a customized version of the validator node module to validate and sanitize user input before saving the job to database, ensuring data validity.

On the database side, we chose MongoDB, a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database. MongoDB features document store in JSON style, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring flexible document attributes like our istar. MongoDB is written in C++, making it easy to manipulate the database from idock, which is also written in C++.

On the workstation side, we deployed a Linux workstation and four Mac workstations. The Linux workstation is equipped with Intel Xeon W3520 @ 2.66 GHz, 8GB DDR3 SDRAM and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285 (1024 MB), and running a minimal version of Fedora 17 x64. The four Mac workstations are equipped with Intel Core i5-2400 @ 3.10GHz and 4GB DDR3 SDRAM, and running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4 Build 11E53.

On the network file system side, we mounted a 2TB hard disk for shared use. All the 5 workstations can simultaneously access to the hard disk and perform file reading and writing. In principle, we will persist existing jobs and results until storage shortage.

\section{idock on istar}

We managed to host idock onto istar. On the client side, our idock web page supports filtering and previewing ligands to dock, as well as monitoring job progress in real time, two very useful features commonly lacked in other SaaS platforms like DOCK Blaster. A new job consists of compulsory fields as well as optional fields. Compulsory fields include a receptor in PDBQT format, a search space defined by a cubic box, a short description of the job, and an email to receive completion notification. Optional fields include filtering conditions of ligands on 9 molecular properties (e.g. molecular weight, partition coefficient xlogP). We set up default values for optional fields, and only the ligands satisfying all the 9 filtering conditions will be docked. We exposed the functionalities of job submission, job query, and ligand counting as RESTful API for others to program against. We recorded a video tutorial for newbies to get started.

On the network file system side, we collected 12,171,187 clean ligands from the ZINC database \citep{532,1178} with explicit permission. We converted all the 12 million ligands into PDBQT format, and combined the 12 million individual files and integrated their 9 molecular properties into one single file as huge as 50GB for subsequent parallel docking. We recorded and encoded the offset of each ligand within that big file for fast random seeking.

On the workstation side, we developed a customized version of idock as a daemon in modern C++11, adding necessary code to iteratively fetch a pending job from MongoDB, reuse receptor and grid maps whenever possible, perform 2-phase docking, report progress to MongoDB, and send email notification upon job completion. Our idock daemon realized two amazing features: 2-phase docking and slice-level parallelism.

On one hand, the idock on istar features 2-phase docking, due to as many as 12 million ligands to screen. In phase 1, idock performs coarse but fast virtual screening without writing any conformations to file, aiming to quickly shortlist a few thousand candidate compounds. In phase 2, idock performs fine but slow virtual screening with a significantly larger number of Monte Carlo tasks per ligand, writing as many conformations to file as possible and aiming to refine the predicted free energy as well as predicted conformation of candidate compounds. Such a 2-phase docking methodology can remarkably reduce job execution time while avoiding the risk of filtering out potentially promising compounds, controlling the false negative rate at an acceptable level.

On the other hand, the idock on istar features slice-level parallelism in phase 1. Generally speaking, multiple workstations can compete for either jobs or slices, with the former known as job-level parallelism and the latter as slice-level parallelism. Job-level parallelism is very straightforward to implement and can ensure high utilization of computational power when the number of jobs exceeds the number of workstations. Nevertheless, when the number of workstations exceeds the number of jobs, slice-level parallelism can better utilize computational power by subdividing a job into slices which are then distributed to workstations. Slice-level parallelism is, in contrast, difficult to implement on both the database side and the workstation side. The technical hurdle becomes even more apparent when results from multiple workstations must be properly combined to produce a final result and progresses from multiple workstations must be properly combined too to compute an overall progress. Finally we succeeded in splitting a job into 100 slices and distributing them to idle workstations in phase 1 to achieve parallel docking.

\section{igrep on istar}

In addition to idock, we also managed to host our igrep \citep{1138} onto istar. igrep is a fast CUDA implementation of agrep algorithm for approximate nucleotide sequence matching. The successful hosting of igrep demonstrates the capability of istar of hosting a general variety of programs.

\section{Discussion}

DOCK Blaster \citep{557}, an expert system, was created to investigate the feasibility of full automation of large-scale protein-ligand docking. Here we highlight the advantages of istar over DOCK Blaster. First and foremost, istar is free and open source under Apache License 2.0. Everyone is welcome to download a copy and deploy istar to his/her own servers. istar is designed as a general SaaS platform. It can host not only idock but also igrep and any other program. istar utilizes HTML5, CSS3, node.js, SPDY protocol, NoSQL, GPU acceleration and so forth, representing a state-of-the-art platform. istar supports filtering and previewing ligands to dock, as well as monitoring job progress in real time, two very useful and unique features only available at istar. istar implements two-phase docking and exploits fine-grained slice-level parallelism in phase 1.

Due to limited budget, we could not offer powerful hardware resource as much as DOCK Blaster did (i.e. 700 CPU cores plus 20TB RAID-6 storage), so we had to try every endeavor on software optimization. Alternatively, one can freely deploy a copy of istar. In the future we plan to port idock to GPU in order to further boost performance.
