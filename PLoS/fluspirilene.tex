\section*{Abstract}
Human hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported to express high level of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), a key factor regulating the cell cycle G1 to S transition and a hallmark for cancers. In this study, we utilized our free and open-source protein-ligand docking software, idock, prospectively to identify potential CDK2 inhibitors from 4,311 FDA-approved small molecule drugs with a repurposing strategy. Among the top compounds sorted by idock score, nine were purchased. Among them, the anti-psychotic drug fluspirilene exhibited the highest anti-proliferative effect in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells. We demonstrated for the first time that fluspirilene treatment significantly increased the percentage of cells in G1 phase, and decreased the expressions of CDK2, cyclin E and Rb, as well as the phosphorylations of CDK2 on Thr160 and Rb on Ser795. We then examined the anti-cancer effect of fluspirilene \textit{in vivo} in BALB/C nude mice subcutaneously xenografted with human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh7 cells. Our results showed that oral fluspirilene treatment significantly and dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth. Fluspirilene (15 mg/kg) exhibited strong anti-tumor activity, comparable to that of the leading cancer drug fluorouracil (10 mg/kg). Moreover, the combination of fluspirilene and fluorouracil exhibited the highest therapeutic effect. These results suggested for the first time that fluspirilene is a potential CDK2 inhibitor and a candidate anti-cancer drug for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma.

%\section*{Author Summary}

\section*{Introduction}
Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK2) is one of the serine/threonine protein kinases. It plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase, and thus in controlling cell proliferation. Abnormally high expression of CDK2 has been reported in many human neoplasias, such as hepatoma, ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. Hence, CDK2 inhibitors are potential effective anti-cancer agents.

Although a number of CDK2 inhibitors have been described in the literature and some have entered clinical trial phases \cite{1603}, e.g. flavopiridol \cite{1596}, roscovitine \cite{1597} and olomoucine \cite{1598}, none of them is available for clinical use due to various reasons such as toxicity and multi-target specificity.

In this study, we used our free and open-source protein-ligand docking software idock \cite{1153,1362} to screen FDA-approved small molecule drugs against CDK2. We adopted the approach of structure-based virtual screening to repurpose approved toxicity-free drugs for the treatment of cancers that involve CDK2 regulation.

\section*{Methods and Materials}

\subsection*{Ensemble docking}

44 X-ray crystallographic structures of CDK2 in complex with a ligand (Table \ref{PDBs}) were collected from the PDB (Protein Data Bank) \cite{540,537}. The co-crystallized ligands and waters were manually removed. The structures of FDA-approved drugs were collected from the dbap and fda catalogs of the ZINC database \cite{532,1178}. The dbap catalog of version 2014-03-19 comprising 1,738 compounds and the fda catalog of version 2012-07-25 comprising 3,176 compounds were downloaded, of which 4,311 compounds were unique. The 44 CDK2 structures in PDB format and the 4,914 compounds in Mol2 format were then converted to PDBQT format using AutoDockTools \cite{596}. Our free and open-source docking software idock v2.1.2 \cite{1153,1362} was then executed to predict the binding conformations and the binding affinities of the 4,914 compounds when docked against the 44 CDK2 structures using an ensemble docking methodology. Finally the compounds were sorted in the ascending order of their predicted binding free energy averaged across the 44 CDK2 structures, and the top commercially available compounds were queried and purchased via http://www.chemicalbook.com/ and subsequently validated \textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo}.

\subsection*{Chemicals and antibodies}

The selected chemicals and the leading cancer drug fluorouracil were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Anti-cyclin D, B1, E, CDK2, Rb, pho-CDK2 (Thr160), pho-Rb (Ser795) and GAPDH were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts, USA.

\subsection*{Cell lines and cell culture}

Hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, USA. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10\% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Rockville, Maryland, USA) at 37$^\circ$C in 5\% CO$_2$ and 95\% humidified air.

\subsection*{Cell culture experimental conditions}

Cells were plated in 96-, 24-, or 6-well plates with 0.125\% FBS medium for 24 hours and then treated with 10\% FBS medium containing the testing compounds at various concentrations of 1, 3, 10, 30$\mu$M, and incubated for 24, 48, or 72 hours.

\subsection*{MTT assay}

Cells were plated at an initial density of 9x10\textsuperscript{3} cells/well in 96 well plates and incubated with 0.5mg/ml 3-(4,5-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide for 4 hours. The medium was then discarded and 200$\mu$l of formazan in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm according the standard protocol. The IC50 values were calculated by Graphpad prime5.

\subsection*{Cell cycle analysis}

HepG2 or Huh7 cells (4x10\textsuperscript{4}) were seeded in 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.125\% FBS, and cultured for 24 hours. The cells were incubated in medium containing 10\% FBS and various doses of fluspirilene (1, 3, 10, 30 $\mu$M) for 12, 24, 36 hours at 37$^\circ$C, then fixed in ice-cold 70\% ethanol and stained with a Coulter DNA-Prep Reagents kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, California, USA). Cellular DNA content of 1x10\textsuperscript{4} cells from each sample was determined with the use of an EPICS ALTRA flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Cell cycle phase distribution was analyzed with the ModFit LT 2.0 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, Maine, USA). All results were obtained from two separate experiments, each of which was done in triplicate.

\subsection*{Western blotting}

HepG2 and Huh7 cells were plated at 6-well plates with 0.125\% FBS medium for 24 hours and then with 10\% FBS medium containing fluspirilene at concentration 3, 10, 30$\mu$M. Cells were harvested after 6 hours of incubation. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail at 4$^\circ$C for 30 minutes. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatants were recovered and the protein concentration was measured by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo). Equal amounts of cell lysates were resolved in 10\% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma). After blocking, the membranes were incubated sequentially with the appropriate diluted primary and secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA). To ensure equal loading of the samples, the membranes were re-probed with an anti-GAPDH antibody (Cell Signalling Technologies).

\subsection*{Fluspirilene treatment \textit{in vivo}}

Female BALB/C nude mice, 4 to 5 weeks old from Vital River Laboratory Technology Co. Ltd, Peking, China, were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions and cared for in accordance with the guidelines of the laboratory animal ethics committee of Kunming Medical University. For the xenografted tumor growth assay, 1x10\textsuperscript{6}/0.2ml PBS Huh7 cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the mice. Tumor size was measured every day. One week after inoculation when the tumors grew to a volume of 80 to 100 m\textsuperscript{3}, the mice were randomly divided into groups of 5 mice per group, and feeded by oral gavage with 0.5\% CMC-NaCl containing fluspirilene (15mg/kg) and by intraperitoneal injection of fluorouracil (10mg/kg) daily for 21 days. The mice were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula $V=ab^2/2$, where $a$ is the longest axis and $b$ is shortest axis.

\subsection*{Statistical analysis}

The results were obtained from at least three different experiments and expressed as mean $\pm$ SD. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test and differences were considered to be statistically significant if p \textless\ 0.05. Statistically significant results are marked with the $\ast$ symbol in the figures.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Ensemble docking results and selection of candidate inhibitors}

Totally 4,914 FDA-approved drugs were docked and ranked according to their average predicted binding affinity across 44 X-ray crystal structures of CDK2. Based on commercial availability, nine top-scoring compounds (Table \ref{Top9}) were selected and purchased for further investigations.

\subsection*{Fluspirilene decreased cell viability of hepatocellular carcinoma}

We first evaluated the anti-cancer effect of the nine compounds by MTT assay (Figure \ref{CellViabilityAgainstConcentration}). All the nine compounds decreased cell viability in HepG2 and Huh7 cells, but had discrepant cytotoxicity at different concentrations. Among them, fluspirilene had the lowest IC50, i.e. 4.017$\mu$M for HepG2 and 3.468$\mu$M for Huh7. In other words, fluspirilene exhibited the highest cytotoxicity compared to the control with statistical significance (p$<$0.05).

Fluspirilene exhibited dose- and time-dependent inhibition effect on cell viability in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines compared to the control (p$<$0.05) (Figure \ref{CellViabilityAgainstTime}). Marked inhibition was observed at 10$\mu$M and 30$\mu$M, but no significant effect was observed at concentrations below 3$\mu$M.

\subsection*{Fluspirilene treatment arrested cell cycle in G1 phase}

We analyzed the effect of fluspirilene treatment with concentrations of 3, 10, 30 $\mu$M for 6, 12, 24 hours on cell cycle profile in HepG2 and Huh7 cells by flow cytometry (Figure \ref{G1Distribution}) in order to understand if fluspirilene inhibited CDK2 activities in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Fluspirilene treatment significantly increased the percentage of cells in G1 phase compared to the control (p$<$0.05) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At 30$\mu$M or 10$\mu$M concentrations, fluspirilene treatment continuously increased the percentage of G1 phase for 24 hours.

Figure \ref{CellCycleDistribution} shows the changes of cell cycle profile of G0-G1, S, and G2-M phases after 24 hours of fluspirilene treatment. The increase of the G1 phase was accompanied by the simultaneous decrease of S and G2-M phases.

\subsection*{Fluspirilene treatment decreased the expressions of CDK2, Rb, cyclin E, pho-CDK2 and pho-Rb, but not cyclin D and cyclin B1}

We investigated the effect of fluspirilene on the expressions of critical proteins involved in G1-to-S transition by western blotting in HepG2 and Huh7 cells (Figure \ref{WesternBlot}). Fluspirilene treatment reduced the expressions of CDK2, Rb, pho-CDK2, pho-Rb and cyclin E. In contrast, the expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 remained unchanged. These results are consistent with what are expected from a CDK2 inhibitor.

\subsection*{Daily oral fluspirilene treatment reduced tumor growth \textit{in vivo}}

To evaluate the effect of fluspirilene on the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma \textit{in vivo}, BALB/C nude mice were subcutaneously injected with Huh7 cells. Carcinoma volumes were measured every 3 to 4 days after tumor appearance. At week 3 after tumor inoculation, the tumor volume reached 80 to 100 mm\textsuperscript{3}, then fluspirilene (15mg/kg in 0.5\% CMC-NaCl by oral gavage), fluorouracil (10 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection), and the combination of fluspirilene (15mg/kg) plus fluorouracil (10 mg/kg) were administered daily for 21 days. At day 21 after treatment, fluspirilene (15 mg/kg) resulted in significant reduction of tumor weight and volume compared to the control (p$<$0.05) (Figure \ref{FluspirileneFluorouracilOnTumorGrowth}). The anti-tumor activity of oral fluspirilene (15 mg/kg) was comparable to that of fluorouracil (10 mg/kg). Importantly, their combinatorial therapy exhibited the highest therapeutic effect. These results suggested for the first time that fluspirilene is a potential CDK2 inhibitor and a candidate anti-cancer drug for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma.

\subsection*{Structural analysis of the predicted conformation of fluspirilene docked against CDK2}

Figure \ref{1GZ8-ZINC00537755-ms} plots the predicted conformation of fluspirilene in complex with CDK2 (PDB ID: 1GZ8) using iview \cite{1366}. Figure \ref{1GZ8-ZINC00537755-pv} plots the intermolecular interaction diagram using PoseView \cite{748}. Fluspirilene was predicted to reside in the ATP-binding site of CDK2 and interact with CDK2 mainly through hydrophobic contacts with Phe82, Ile10, His84 and Leu134, and a hydrogen bond with Lys33.

\section*{Discussion}

Cell cycle progress is sequentially and strictly processed through the interactions of CDKs and cyclins. Different cyclin-CDK complexes are activated in different phases of the cell cycle. When the cell cycle goes through G1 to S phase, the cyclin D1-CDK4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes are ordinally activated and the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is hyper-phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. The hyper-phosphorylated pRB promotes the release of E2F transcription factors, which in turn facilitate the transcription of numerous genes required for G1 to S transition and S phase progression. From the medicinal perspective, CDK2 has long been a classical and important target for cancer therapy.

Though a number of CDK2 inhibitors have entered clinical trial phases, none has been officially approved for clinical use, probably because of their toxicity and multi-target specificity. Given the obstacle that developing a new drug \textit{de novo} is a laborious and costly endeavor, repurposing toxicity-free old drugs for new uses is a favorable strategy.

The powerful synergy of \textit{in silico} methods in drug repurposing by structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was highlighted in several recent reports \cite{1384}. To name a few successful repurposing cases by SBVS, \cite{1507} rediscovered 2,4-Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid, a well-known plant auxin, as a new anti-inflammatory agent through \textit{in silico} molecular modeling and docking studies along with drug formulation and \textit{in vivo} anti-inflammatory inspection; \cite{1506} attempted to repurpose FDA-approved drugs by an integrated SBVS approach and reported the discovery of piperacillin \textbf{1} as an inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) in cell-free and cell-based systems with high selectivity.

In addition to SBVS, ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) also finds its successful applications in repurposing. \cite{1504} used Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR) \cite{1379} to search for compounds with similar shape to a previously reported inhibitor of protein arginine deiminase type 4 (PAD4), a new therapeutic target for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and identified a novel compound that has a strikingly different structure from the template inhibitor yet showed significant inhibition on the enzymatic activity of PAD4.

Encouraged by these successful stories, in this study we adopted the repurposing strategy, and utilized the computational methodology of SBVS by protein-ligand docking to shortlist candidates from FDA-approved small molecule drugs. Specifically, we used our fast docking program idock \cite{1153,1362} in combination with our convenient visualizer iview \cite{1366} for the task of rediscovering existing drugs as CDK2 inhibitors. idock is an exciting development not only because it has been vigorously shown \cite{1362} to outperform the state-of-the-art docking software AutoDock Vina \cite{595} in terms of docking speed by at least 8.69 times and at most 37.51 times while maintaining comparable redocking success rates, but also because it is free and open source under a permissive license. The latter guarantees that users from both industry and academia can freely utilize idock in their own projects that require protein-ligand docking.

To facilitate the use of idock, its input arguments and output results were purposely designed to be similar to those of AutoDock Vina, therefore existing users can easily transit to idock and benefit from considerable speedup in SBVS performance. Moreover, to promote prospective SBVS by idock, a web server called istar \cite{1362} was developed and made available at http://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/idock, where there are as many as over 23 million purchasable small molecule compounds ready for docking against any protein supplied by the user. Both idock \cite{1153} and istar \cite{1362} would hopefully supplement the efforts of medicinal chemists in drug discovery research.

Regarding the structural data in use, there are so far as many as 347 solved X-ray crystal structures of CDK2 with a UniProt ID of P24941. To account for their structural variability and to mine knowledge from multiple structures of CDK2, we selected 44 holo structures of CDK2 in a bound state with a ligand in complex to carry out ensemble docking. The final score used to prioritize compounds was purposely designed to be the average score of that compound when docked to the 44 selected structures of CDK2 with their native ligand removed manually before docking. In this way the top-scoring compounds would guarantee a consistent binding strength on average. In the aspect of data source of approved drugs, although we chose the dbap and fda catalogs of the ZINC database \cite{532,1178}, it is also possible to use some other freely accessible drug databases such as NCGC \cite{1608}, DrugBank \cite{1594}, KEGG DRUG \cite{1595} and e-Drug 3D \cite{1125}.

After ensemble docking experiments with idock \cite{1153,1362} followed by careful visual inspections with iview \cite{1366}, we purchased nine top-ranking compounds for subsequent wet experiments. Among them, fluspirilene was selected for further investigations because its IC50 was less than 10 umol/L as determined by MTT assay. Fluspirilene is currently used for the therapy of chronic schizophrenia.% Its anti-cancer effect \textit{in vitro} was recently reported \cite{1606}, but was never investigated \textit{in vivo}.

In this study, we reported for the first time that fluspirilene is a potential CDK2 inhibitor, and demonstrated for the first time that oral administration of fluspirilene (15 mg/kg) exhibited significant and strong anti-cancer efficacy comparable to the leading cancer drug fluorouracil (10 mg/kg) \textit{in vivo} in nude mice xenografted with hepatoma Huh7 cells. Most importantly, the combination of effective dose of fluspirilene and fluorouracil produced even higher therapeutic effect, indicating that fluspirilene may work through a different mechanism than fluorouracil, which further indicates that fluspirilene could be combined with other chemotherapy drugs to achieve synergistic therapeutic effect.

No obvious toxicity was previously reported by intraperitoneal injection of 8 mg/kg fluspirilene in male wistar rats \cite{1610}. In this study, we did not observe significant change in body weight by oral administration of fluspirilene (15 mg/kg) for 21 days, suggesting that oral or intraperitoneal injection of fluspirilene is relatively safe.

The inhibitory rate of 10 mg/kg fluorouracil on d2 in female BALB/C \textit{in situ} hepatocellular carcinoma models with HCM-Y89 cell by intravenous injection was 48.14\% at 20 day of post-treatment \cite{1609}. In this study, we found that the inhibitory rate of 10 mg/kg fluorouracil on d21 in female BALB/C nude mice xenografted models with Huh7 cells by intraperitoneal injection was 85.4\%, without showing any body weight change, suggesting that intraperitoneal administration of fluorouracil is relatively safe and effective.

%Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide \cite{}. Only 30\% to 40\% of the patients with HCC are eligible for curative treatments, which include surgical resection as the first option, liver transplantation and percutaneous ablation. However, there is a high frequency of tumor recurrence after surgical resection and most HCC seem resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Thus, the development of novel therapies against HCC is urgently required.

\section*{Conclusions}

This study presents a successful prospective application of idock \cite{1153,1362} in identifying CDK2 inhibitors from FDA-approved small molecule drugs using a repurposing strategy. We showed that fluspirilene, currently used for the therapy of chronic schizophrenia, exhibited anti-cancer effect in human hepatoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells. We demonstrated for the first time that oral fluspirilene treatment significantly and dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth. Most importantly, the combinatorial therapy of fluspirilene and the leading cancer drug fluorouracil exhibited higher therapeutic effect. These results suggested for the first time that fluspirilene is a potential CDK2 inhibitor and a candidate anti-cancer drug for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma. The potential application of fluspirilene combined with other chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of hepatoma neoplasms and other cancers warrants further studies.
