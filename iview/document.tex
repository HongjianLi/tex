\section{Introduction}

Visualization of protein-ligand complex plays an important role in elaborating protein-ligand interactions and aiding novel drug design. To date, dozens of visualization tools already exist. VMD \citep{1220}, PyMOL \citep{1221} and Chimera \citep{1219} are very well-known and highly cited. They can interpret multiple file formats and generate multiple representations to supply precise and powerful control. AutoDockTools4 \citep{596} provides native support for the PDBQT file format, which is widely used in various protein-ligand docking software such as AutoDock \citep{596}, AutoDock Vina \citep{595}, and our idock \citep{1153}. A case study \citep{1321} is presented to process large amounts of geometry data for real-time 3D exploration, superimposition, and interactive navigational tasks in a virtual reality environment. We also developed our own method \citep{1265} to visualize structures in virtual reality settings and employ fragment-based \textit{de novo} ligand design strategy for interactive drug design. PoseView \citep{748} and LigPlot+ \citep{951}, on the other hand, plot 2D diagrams of protein-ligand interactions from 3D coordinates.

In addition, there are web visualizers based on either Java applet, Adobe Flash, or HTML5 canvas. Jmol (http://www.jmol.org), an open source Java viewer for chemical structures in 3D, has been deployed worldwide and recognized as the \textit{de facto} molecular viewer on the web. JSmol \citep{1314}, a JavaScript-only version of Jmol, includes the full implementation of the entire set of Jmol functionalities. GLmol (http://webglmol.sourceforge.jp), a molecular viewer on WebGL/Javascript using the three.js library, supports multiple file formats and representations, and features an experimental version of surface construction based on the EDTSurf algorithm \citep{1297}. Another study \citep{1262} also presents a WebGL technology for rendering molecular surface using the SpiderGL library \citep{1320}. ChemDoodle Web Components (http://web.chemdoodle.com), a pure Javascript chemical graphics and cheminformatics library, presents 2D and 3D graphics and animations for chemical structures, reactions and spectra. ePlant \citep{1242}, a suite of open-source Flash-based web tools, visualizes integrative systems biology from the model organism \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}. PLI \citep{1288} is a web-based tool for the comparison of protein-ligand interactions observed on PDB structures. BioJS \citep{1308} is an open source JavaScript framework for biological data visualization. There is a review that covers a history of web-based structure input \citep{1243}.

However, the existing web visualizers are either too complicated to use, or lack virtual reality support. Inspired by ChemDoodle Web Components and GLmol, we have developed iview, an easy-to-use interactive WebGL visualizer of protein-ligand complex, featuring special effects in virtual reality settings. Furthermore, we have recently developed a web platform called istar in order to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our idock \citep{1153}. Apart from the feature-rich version of iview, we have also developed a neat and tailor-made version specifically for idock jobs.

%Modern browsers nowadays, e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera, support WebGL. IE11 will support WebGL too.

\begin{methods}
\section{Methods}

iview is refactored from GLmol 0.47. It loads protein-ligand structures from the PDB (Protein Data Bank) \cite{539,537} as its data source.
Camera: perspective, orthographic
Background: black, grey, white
Color by: spectrum, chain, secondary structure, B factor, residue, polarity, atom
Primary structure: line, stick, ball-and-stick, sphere, nothing
Secondary structure: ribbon, strand, cylinder and plate, C alpha trace, nothing
EDTSurf \citep{1297} is an fast algorithm to generating triangulated macromolecular surfaces by Euclidean distance transform.
Protein surface: Van der Waals surface, solvent excluded surface, solvent accessible surface, molecular surface 
Surface opacity
Wireframe
Rotate, translate, zoom in/out, slab with mouse
Export canvas to png


Protein and top hit ligands in PDBQT format
Search space in cubic box
Top 100 ligand switch
Putative hydrogen bonds
10 molecular properties
suppliers

The marketed HIV drug maraviroc is rendered as stick colored by atom types. It can be clearly seen that the CCR5 forms a deep allosteric cavity where maraviroc is buried.}\label{fig:4MBS}
