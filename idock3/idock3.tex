\begin{abstract}

Protein-ligand docking is a key computational method in the design of starting points for the drug discovery process. We are motivated by the desire to accelerate large-scale docking and have thus developed idock 3 to utilize the tremendous computational power of GPU clusters.

\section{Introduction}

Protein-ligand docking predicts the preferred conformation and binding affinity of a small ligand as non-covalently bound to the specific binding site of a protein. Docking can therefore be used not only to determine whether a ligand binds, but also to understand how it binds. The latter is subsequently important to improve the potency and selectivity of binding. To date, there are hundreds of docking programs \cite{493,922}. The AutoDock series \cite{597,596,595} is the most cited docking software in the research community, with over 5,000 citations according to Google Scholar. AutoDock has contributed to the discovery of several drugs, including the first clinically approved HIV integrase inhibitor \cite{1169}. Following its initial release, several parallel implementations were developed using either multithreading or computer cluster \cite{115,560,782}.

In 2009, AutoDock Vina \cite{595} was released. As the successor of AutoDock 4 \cite{596}, AutoDock Vina significantly improves the average accuracy of the binding mode predictions while running two orders of magnitude faster with multithreading \cite{595}. It was compared to AutoDock 4 on selecting active compounds against HIV protease, and was recommended for docking large molecules \cite{556}. Its functionality of semi-flexible protein docking by enabling flexibility of side-chain residues was evaluated on VEGFR-2 \cite{1084}. To further facilitate the usage of AutoDock Vina, auxiliary tools were subsequently developed, including a PyMOL \cite{1221} plugin for program settings and visualization \cite{609}, a bootable operating system for computer clusters \cite{773}, a console application for virtual screening on Windows \cite{1268}, and a GUI for virtual screening on Windows \cite{1250}.

In 2011, inspired by AutoDock Vina, we developed idock 1.0 \cite{1153}, a multithreaded virtual screening tool for flexible ligand docking. idock introduces plenty of innovations, such as caching receptor and grid maps in memory to permit efficient large-scale docking, revised numerical model for much faster energy approximation, capability of automatic detection and deactivation of inactive torsions for dimensionality reduction, utilization of our lightweight thread pool to parallelize grid map creation and reuse threads, utilization of the new C++11 programming features to avoid frequent memory reallocation, and accelerated parsers for both receptors and ligands. When benchmarked on docking 10,928 drug-like ligands against HIV reverse transcriptase, idock 1.0 achieved a speedup of 3.3 in terms of CPU time and a speedup of 7.5 in terms of elapsed time on average compared to AutoDock Vina, making idock one of the fastest docking software.

Having released idock, we kept receiving docking requests from our colleagues and collaborators. They are mostly biochemists and pharmacologists, outsourcing the docking research to us after discovering pharmaceutical protein targets for certain diseases of therapeutic interest. Consequently, we had to grab the protein structure, do format conversion, define search space, set up docking parameters, and keep running idock in batch for months. Tedious enough, all the above work was done manually, resulting in very low research productivity. In order to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our idock, we have therefore developed a web platform called istar.

\subsection{CUDA Kernel Design}

Address Spaces
global, constant, shared, local
Data Structures
AOS to SOA to meet requirements of global memory coalesced access.

\subsection{Scheduling Models}

In Vina, threads are created just in time. Suffer from thread construction and destruction overhead.

In idock 2.0, a lightweight thread pool, to reuse threads.

In idock 3.0, 
Central dispatcher, multiple devices as concurrent consumers, each has a command queue
device queue size = 1, main thread syncs with device before fetching next task
Overlap host threads with device threads
Thread construction and destruction overhead is one off.

HyperQ on compute capability 3.5 and higher, and Souther Islands
Parallel compute and transfer, applied to CPU too
device queue size > 1
