\chapter{idock: protein-ligand docking}

\section{Abstract}

AutoDock Vina is a competitive protein-ligand docking tool well known for its fast execution and high accuracy. Nevertheless, when docking a massive number of ligands, Vina has to be run multiple times, repeating receptor parsing and grid maps building over and over again. There are tremendous requests for revising Vina to reuse precalculated data and incorporate built-in support for virtual screening. Hence we developed idock, inheriting from AutoDock Vina the accurate scoring function and the efficient optimization algorithm, and significantly improving the fundamental implementation and numerical model for even faster execution. idock achieves a speedup of 3.3 in terms of CPU time and a speedup of 7.5 in terms of elapsed time on average. idock is free and open source, available at https://GitHub.com/HongjianLi/idock.

This project was published in the \textit{Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)} on 9 May 2012 \citep{1153}.

\section{Introduction}

Over recent decades, there has been a continual increase in the number of new therapeutic targets available for drug design. Advances in crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have revealed substantial structural details of proteins and proteinâ€“ligand complexes. The structures of biological macromolecules at atomic level are being routinely resolved and deposited into the world's largest and freely accessible repository called Protein Data Bank (PDB) \citep{539,537}. Meanwhile, the biological activity data of small molecules are also being regularly collected into public databases such as ChEMBL \citep{1424} and PubChem \citep{1422}. As of 15 Sep 2014, there are 103,199 structures in PDB, 1,638,394 compounds records in ChEMBL and 1,112,090 bioassays in PubChem. The rapid evolution of structure resolving techniques and the availability of structural and bioactivity resources highly catalyze the development of protein-ligand docking methods for structure-based virtual screening. Very often, the target protein is a viral enzyme of interest, and the small organic ligands that are predicted to inhibit the viral enzyme are what we want to discover.

Protein-ligand docking is a method which predicts the preferred conformation and binding affinity of a small ligand when bound to a macro protein to form a stable complex. The ligand conformation refers to its spatial position, orientation, and torsions, if any. Figure \ref{idock:MRV} shows the crystal conformation and a docked conformation of the marketed HIV drug maraviroc in complex with the human CCR5 chemokine receptor (PDB: 4MBS). The protein is rendered in molecular surface representation, where positively- and negative-charged regions are in blue and red, respectively. The ligand is rendered in stick representation with the same color scheme, where oxygen and nitrogen atoms are in blue and red, respectively. The binding cavity on the protein surface is depicted by a green cubic box. The putative intermolecular hydrogen bonds are shown as cyan dashed lines. The docked conformation was predicted by idock \citep{1153} and the figure was rendered by iview \citep{1366}.

The binding affinity is a numerical value that suggests how strongly the interactions are formed between the protein and the ligand upon binding. Empirically, it is the overall effect of various chemical interactions involved, such as van der Waals force, electrostatic force, salt bridges, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, pi interactions, halogen interactions, metal interactions, and the like. It is usually estimated by the scoring function employed in a docking tool. The binding affinity is usually expressed in pKd unit, which is the negative logarithm of dissociation constant Kd. In Figure \ref{idock:MRV} the binding affinities of the crystal and docked conformations were predicted to be 8.27 and 8.01 pKd, respectively, by RF-Score \citep{564}. The binding affinity can be alternatively expressed in terms of free energy $\Delta G$ in kcal/mol unit, which is usually a negative value. The lower the free energy, the higher the binding affinity.

Structure-based virtual screening can be regarded as a massive version of docking. Instead of a single ligand, a database of ligands are docked against the target protein, then ranked according to their predicted binding affinity, and finally the top ones are selected for further investigations.

When a docking program is treated as a black box, its input includes the 3D structures of a protein and a ligand, and its output includes several predicted conformations and their predicted binding affinity. Regarding the protein input, the PDB database \citep{539,537} almost serves as the unique \textit{de facto} data source. Regarding the ligand input, there are dozens of data sources. The GDB-17 database \citep{1276} enumerates 166 billion organic small molecules. The PubChem database \citep{526} comprises 53 million unique structures. The ZINC database \citep{532,1178} contains over 35 million purchasable compounds in ready-to-dock, 3D formats. The TCM@Taiwan database \citep{528} comprises 37,170 TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) compounds from 352 TCM ingredients. Regarding the output visualization and analysis, PyMOL \citep{1221}, Chimera \citep{1219}, VMD \citep{1220}, AutoDockTools4 \citep{596}, ViewDock TDW \citep{559}, PoseView \citep{748} and LigPlot+ \citep{951} are popular tools to visualize docked conformations and plot putative interaction charts. AuPosSOM \citep{598} can be used to cluster docked conformations. BEDROC \citep{490} and SLR \citep{489} can be used as statistical metrics for docking method evaluation.

When a docking program is treated as a white box, it consists of two typical components, an algorithm to explore the conformational space, and a scoring function to predict the binding affinity given a sampled conformation. There is a huge body of docking tools, e.g. DOCK \citep{1222,1445}, AutoDock 4 \citep{596}, AutoDock Vina \citep{595}, QuickVina \citep{1193}, PLANTS \citep{610,607,779}, FITTED \citep{602,603}, CDOCK \citep{1224}, CRDOCK \citep{1200}, and PharmDock \citep{1376}, as well as scoring functions, e.g. RF-Score \citep{564,1370}, SFCscore \citep{581,1347}, LISA \citep{775}, and NNScore 2.0 \citep{977}. More can be found in survey papers \citep{493,922}.

Amongst a sea of docking programs, AutoDock Vina \citep{595} (hereafter Vina for short) is a competitive one because not only it is free and open source under Apache License 2.0, but also it has been shown to improve the average accuracy of the binding mode predictions \citep{595} and run faster than its predecessor AutoDock 4 \citep{596} by an order of magnitude when benchmarking on virtual screening for HIV protease inhibitors \citep{556}. Released in the second half of 2010, Vina has been cited over 1,000 times and adopted by a wide community of researchers. Apart from the Vina docking tool itself, there is a PyMOL plugin for AutoDock and Vina \citep{609}. MOLA \citep{773} is a bootable, self-configuring system for virtual screening using AutoDock4/Vina on computer clusters. VSDK \citep{1268} is a console application system of virtual screening of small molecules using AutoDock Vina on Windows. AUDocker LE \citep{1250} is a GUI for virtual screening with AutoDock Vina on Windows. All these auxiliary tools facilitate the use of Vina under various settings.%TODO: update Vina citation count.

Vina is attractive thanks to a series of success stories by third parties. To name a few, Vina was used for 1) docking studies on the HEPT derivatives of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase \citep{843}, 2) for side-chain residue flexibility study of VEGFR-2 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2), which is a known protein target for anti-angiogenic agents \citep{1084}, 3) for identification of novel inhibitors of sirtuin 2, which is a NAD\textsuperscript{+}-dependent histone deacetylase enzyme \citep{1177}, and 4) for repurposing study of FDA-approved drugs for cancer therapy in order to screen for compounds that potentially inhibit MDM2, which an E3 ubiquitin ligase that polyubiquitinates p53 \citep{1230}. Such exciting success stories prove the real power of protein-ligand docking, Vina in particularly, for computer-aided drug discovery.

Although Vina is popular and competitive and well known for its fast execution and high accuracy, it is optimized for single-ligand docking rather than virtual screening. When it comes to docking a large pool of ligands, Vina has to be invoked multiple times, repeatedly parsing the same protein and creating the same internal data structures such as grid maps. There are enormous requests from the community for modifying and recompiling Vina to make it support virtual screening in a superfast manner by reusing protein data and grid maps. We were motivated by the desire to provide built-in support for virtual screening and therefore developed idock. Moreover, we incorporated quite many implementation tricks to further speedup idock. Lastly, we utilized idock to attempt to address a real life drug discovery problem.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{PDBQT specification}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../usrt/T27CrystalPDBQT.png}
\caption{PDBQT content of a ligand.}
\label{idock:PDBQT}
\end{figure}

Ligands can be treated as flexible in PDBQT format, used by AutoDock series \citep{597,596}, Vina \citep{595}, idock \citep{1153}, QVina \citep{1193}. In PDBQT format, the structure of a ligand can be represented by a tree structure of frames, where a frame is the largest connected unit with no rotatable bonds. There are three types of frames: root frame, inner frame, and leaf frame. A root frame has no parent frame and has zero or more child frames. A inner frame has one parent frame and one or more child frames. A leaf frame has one parent frame and no child frames. A ligand must have a root frame, and could have inner or leaf frames.

The idea of a torsion tree to represent the rigid and rotatable pieces. There is always one root, and zero or more branches. Branches can be nested. Every branch defines one rotatable bond. The torsion tree is represented in the PDBQT with the following records, and the placement of these records is important, and usually means reordering the ATOM/HETATM records: % http://autodock.scripps.edu/faqs-help/faq/what-is-the-format-of-a-pdbqt-file

A ROOT record precedes the rigid part of the molecule, from which zero or more rotatable bonds may emanate.

The rigid root contains one or more PDBQT-style ATOM or HETATM records. These records resemble their traditional PDB counterparts, but diverge in columns 71-79 inclusive (where the first character in the line corresponds to column 1). The partial charge is stored in columns 71-76 inclusive (in \%6.3f format, i.e. right-justified, 6 characters wide, with 3 decimal places). The AutoDock atom-type is stored in columns 78-79 inclusive (in \%-2.2s format, i.e. left-justified and 2 characters wide.

An ENDROOT record follows the last atom in the rigid root. The ROOT/ENDROOT block of atoms should be given first in the PDBQT file. The simplest way to treat a ligand is rigidly, and this would mean putting a ROOT record before the first ATOM/HETATM and an ENDROOT record after the last ATOM/HETATM.

Sets of atoms that are moved by rotatable bonds are enclosed by BRANCH and ENDBRANCH records. These BRANCH/ENDBRANCH blocks follow the ROOT/ENDROOT block. Both BRANCH records and ENDBRANCH records should give two integers separated by spaces, which are the serial numbers of the first and second atoms involved in the rotatable bond. The BRANCH record should be followed by the ATOM/HETATM record of the second atom in the rotatable bond. It is possible to nest BRANCH/ENDBRANCH blocks; see the example below.

The last atom in a branch should be followed by an ENDBRANCH record, whose serial numbers of the two atoms in the rotatable bond should match those in the corresponding BRANCH record.

The last line of the PDBQT file contains a TORSDOF record, which is followed by an integer. This is the number of torsional degrees of freedom in the ligand, and is independent of the number of rotatable bonds, if any, defined by the preceding records.

The serial number is the integer in columns 7-11 inclusive of the ATOM or HETATM record; the first character in the line corresponds to column 1.

\subsection{Conformational modeling}

A conformation refers to a vector of position, orientation, and torsions if any (Figure \ref{idock:DOF}).

\subsection{Flowchart}

Figure \ref{idock:Flowchart} shows the overall flowchart of idock. During initialization, idock precalculates the scoring function for all possible combinations of atom type pairs and interatomic distances. It parses the receptor and determines the atom types with the aid of residue sequence, and creates a thread pool to hold reusable threads. Then it enters a loop and fetches a ligand from a user-specified input folder to perform docking. It parses the ligand and determines the atom types with the aid of branch information, and meanwhile automatically detects and deactivates inactive torsions. It builds grid maps of granularity 0.15625 \AA\ by default on the fly by multithreading, and distributes multiple independent Monte Carlo tasks to the thread pool for concurrent execution. Then it merges the conformations from separate threads and clusters them with RMSD 2.0 \AA, and dumps them to the user-specified output folder and displays the predicted free energy on screen. It proceeds with the next ligand automatically until all are docked. Finally it destroys the thread pool and releases memory resources.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Scoring function}
% In Vina, the binding affinity is evaluated as free energy. The lower the free energy, the higher the binding affinity.
Both idock and Vina share exactly the same scoring function, which is made up of a conformation-dependent part and a conformation-independent part. The conformation-dependent part is a weighted sum of five terms over all the pairs of atom $i$ and atom $j$ that can move relative to each other. It is calculated from equations \eqref{idock:e} and \eqref{idock:eij} where $t_i$ and $t_j$ are the atom types of $i$ and $j$ respectively, and $r_{ij}$ is their interatomic distance. The five terms are calculated from equations \eqref{idock:Gauss1} to \eqref{idock:HBonding} where $d_{ij}$ is the surface distance calculated from equation \eqref{idock:dij} where $R_{t_i}$ and $R_{t_j}$ are the Van der Waals radii of $t_i$ and $t_j$ respectively (Figure \ref{idock:Distance}). All the units are in \AA. The weighting coefficients and the cut off at $r_{ij}$ = 8 \AA\ of the five terms are borrowed from Vina. The optimization algorithm attempts to find the global minimum of $e$ and other low-scoring conformations, which it then ranks.

\begin{equation}
\label{idock:e}
e = \sum_{i < j} e_{ij}
\end{equation}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{idock:eij}
e_{ij} &=& (-0.035579) * Gauss_1(t_i, t_j, r_{ij}) \nonumber \\
       &+& (-0.005156) * Gauss_2(t_i, t_j, r_{ij}) \nonumber \\
       &+& (+0.840245) * Repulsion(t_i, t_j, r_{ij}) \nonumber \\
       &+& (-0.035069) * Hydrophobic(t_i, t_j, r_{ij}) \nonumber \\
       &+& (-0.587439) * HBonding(t_i, t_j, r_{ij})
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{equation}
\label{idock:Gauss1}
Gauss_1(t_i, t_j, r_{ij}) = e^{-(d_{ij} / 0.5)^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{idock:Gauss2}
Gauss_2(t_i, t_j, r_{ij}) = e^{-((d_{ij} - 3) / 2)^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{idock:Repulsion}
Repulsion(t_i, t_j, r_{ij}) =
\begin{cases}
d_{ij}^2 & \text{if } d_{ij} < 0\\
0 &\text{if } d_{ij} \geq 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{idock:Hydrophobic}
Hydrophobic(t_i, t_j, r_{ij}) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } d_{ij} \leq 0.5\\
1.5 - d_{ij} & \text{if } 0.5 < d_{ij} < 1.5\\
0 & \text{if } d_{ij} \geq 1.5\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{idock:HBonding}
HBonding(t_i, t_j, r_{ij}) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } d_{ij} \leq -0.7\\
d_{ij} / (-0.7) & \text{if } -0.7 < d_{ij} < 0\\
0 & \text{if } d_{ij} \geq 0\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{idock:dij}
d_{ij} = r_{ij} - (R_{t_i} + R_{t_j})
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../idock/Distance.png}
\caption{Relationship between surface distance $d_{ij}$ and interatomic distance $r_{ij}$.}
\label{idock:Distance}
\end{figure}

The conformation-dependent part can be seen as the sum of intermolecular and intramolecular contributions. Hence equation \eqref{idock:e} can be rewritten into equation \eqref{idock:inter+intra} where $e_{inter}$ is the summation over all the heavy atoms between receptor and ligand, and $e_{intra}$ is the summation over all the 1-4 ligand heavy atoms that are separated by three consecutive covalent bonds and can move relative to each other.

\begin{equation}
\label{idock:inter+intra}
e = e_{inter} + e_{intra}
\end{equation}

The conformation-independent part penalizes $e_{inter}$ for ligand flexibility. The predicted free energy of the $k$th conformation for output, denoted as $e'_k$, is calculated from equation \eqref{idock:FlexibilityPenalty} where $k$ is the subscript for conformation, $e_k$ is the conformation-dependent score of the $k$th conformation calculated from equation \eqref{idock:e}, $e_{intra,1}$ is the $e_{intra}$ of the first, i.e. lowest-scoring conformation, $N_{ActTors}$ is the number of active torsions and $N_{InactTors}$ is the number of inactive torsions of the ligand. Note that $e_{intra,1}$, rather than $e_{intra,k}$, acts as subtrahend in order to preserve the ranking.

\begin{equation}
\label{idock:FlexibilityPenalty}
e'_k = \frac{e_k - e_{intra,1}}{1 + 0.05846 * (N_{ActTors} + 0.5 * N_{InactTors})}
\end{equation}

The value of $e_{ij}$ is basically a function of three variables, namely $t_i$, $t_j$, and $r_{ij}$. These three variables have both a known lower bound and a known upper bound, so it is possible to precalculate the scoring function. Since there are 17 atom types implemented in idock, the pair of $t_i$ and $t_j$ can have 153 (=17*18/2) different combinations. Since $r_{ij}$ is cut off at 8 \AA, idock uniformly samples 16,384 points in range [0, 8] to turn the continuous domain into a concrete domain, resulting in an average absolute error of merely 0.002 kcal/mol. During program initialization, idock precalculates $e_{ij}$ from equation \eqref{idock:eij} for 153*16384 possible combinations of $t_i$, $t_j$, and $r_{ij}$. During optimization, idock approximates the true value of $e_{ij}$ by direct assignment rather than linear interpolation for faster evaluation of $e_{ij}$ at the cost of a little bit longer precalculation time and a bit more memory storage.

\subsection{Grid maps}

In order to fast evaluate $e_{inter}$, grid maps are often built. A grid map of atom type \textit{t} is constructed by placing virtual probe atoms of atom type \textit{t} along the X, Y, Z dimensions of the search box at a certain granularity (Figure \ref{idock:GridMap}). The $e_{inter}$ value of these probe atoms are precalculated, so the $e_{inter}$ value of a ligand heavy atom can be approximated in some way. In Vina, the grid map granularity is hard coded to be 0.375 \AA, and the approximation is done by linear interpolation of the 8 corner probe atoms of the residing subbox. This kind of interpolation involves reading of 8 $e_{inter}$ values, computation of 3 $\alpha$ values, 12 floating-point subtractions, 24 floating-point multiplications, and 7 floating-point additions, which turned out to be a performance bottleneck when we profiled Vina. In contrast, idock exposes grid map granularity as an optional program argument with a tuned default value of 0.15625 \AA. Likewise, due to a higher density of probe atoms, idock substitutes direct assignment for linear interpolation for much faster evaluation of $e_{inter}$ at the cost of longer precalculation time and larger memory storage. Therefore, the creation of grid maps is carried out on the fly only when necessary and abstracted into parallel tasks, which are then distributed to the thread pool for concurrent execution.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../idock/GridMap.png}
\caption{Grid map for fast evaluation of $e_{inter}$. Probe atoms are shown in purple.}
\label{idock:GridMap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Optimization algorithm}

Both idock and Vina use Monte Carlo algorithm for global optimization and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) \citep{786} Quasi-Newton method for local optimization. A succession of steps consisting of a mutation and a BFGS local optimization are taken, with each step being accepted according to the Metropolis criterion (Figure \ref{idock:MonteCarlo}, modified from \citep{493}). These steps are repeated over \textit{N} iterations, where \textit{N} correlates to the complexity of the ligand regarding number of heavy atoms and number of torsions. BFGS approximates the inverse Hessian matrix of the scoring function. It uses not only the value of the scoring function but also its gradient, which are the derivatives of the scoring function with respect to the position and orientation of the ligand, and the torsions for the active rotatable bonds in the ligand. A BFGS iteration derives a descent direction from the approximate inverse Hessian matrix, derives a step length along the descent direction by line search, and updates the approximation of inverse Hessian matrix. Both programs achieve multithreading by concurrently running multiple independent Monte Carlo tasks starting from random initial conformations.

Though both programs share similar optimization algorithms, their implementations differ. Compared with Vina, the Monte Carlo iterations in idock are far fewer and the BFGS iterations are more. On one hand, the fewer number of Monte Carlo iterations is compensated by a larger number of parallel Monte Carlo tasks, which is 64 by default in idock compared to 8 in Vina, guaranteeing better conformational diversity and higher CPU utilization on multi-core computers. On the other hand, the stopping criterion of BFGS local optimization does not depend on an estimated number of iterations, which is the case in Vina, but depends on the outcome of line search. The BFGS local optimization stops if and only if no appropriate step length can be obtained by line search, thus increasing the probability of finding optimal local minimums.

\subsection{Native support of virtual screening}

Vina is optimized for single-ligand docking rather than virtual screening. When it comes to docking a large pool of ligands, Vina has to be invoked multiple times, repeatly parsing the same receptor and creating the same grid maps, thus degrading performance.

idock supports virtual screening in a native manner. It docks a directory of ligands instead of a single ligand, and reuses receptor and grid maps (note the loop in the flowchart). Given a very large amount of ligands to dock, idock indirectly supports two-phase virtual screening via two consecutive runs. In the first run, idock performs coarse but fast virtual screening without writing any conformations to file, aiming to quickly shortlist a few candidate compounds. In the second run, idock performs fine but slow virtual screening with a significantly larger number of Monte Carlo tasks per ligand, writing as many conformations to file as possible and aiming to refine the predicted free energy as well as predicted conformation of candidate compounds. Such a 2-phase docking methodology can remarkably reduce overall execution time while avoiding the risk of filtering out potentially promising compounds, controlling the false negative rate at an acceptable level.

\subsection{Detection of inactive torsions}

idock automatically detects and deactivates inactive torsions, which are presented and activated in the input file in pdbqt format but have no impact on the overall scoring, such as \textemdash{OH} and \textemdash{NH$_2$}, because they only rotate the hydrogens. Figure \ref{idock:InactiveTorsions} shows an example ligand which contains 4 active torsions defined by the python script \textit{prepare\_ligand4.py} provided by AutoDock Tools \citep{785,596}. Two of them, highlighted in yellow, only rotate hydrogens and thus have no contributions to the scoring. They are re-classified as inactive torsions and deactivated while being parsed in idock. This kind of automatic detection and deactivation of inactive torsions reduces the torsional degrees of freedom to optimize in the local optimization step, leading to easier finding of local minimums.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../idock/InactiveTorsions.png}
\caption{Example of inactive torsions highlighted in yellow. Nonpolar hydrogens are not shown for clarity.}
\label{idock:InactiveTorsions}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Miscellaneous improvements}

idock implements a lightweight thread pool in order to reuse threads and maintain a high CPU utilization throughout the entire screening procedure. During program initialization, idock creates a thread pool of $N$ threads, where $N$ is the number of CPU cores automatically detected, or can be specified by user via a command line argument. When idle, the threads sleep. When tasks arrive, the threads compete for tasks. The thread that completes its current task will automatically fetch a pending one to execute until all are done. Synchronization is implemented to ensure the full completeness of tasks and availability of results. The task here is an abstract concept in programming sense and can be instantiated either as scoring function tasks, grid map tasks or Monte Carlo tasks. To be exact, the thread pool in fact parallelizes the precalculation of scoring function, the creation of grid maps, and the execution of Monte Carlo tasks.

idock enables automatic recovery. While docking is in progress, in case the process gets killed accidentally and restarted some time later, idock not only resumes docking from the previous stopping point, skipping ligands that were already docked in a previous run, but also detects and reports possible file content errors, ensuring all the output ligands are well written.

idock supports reading and writing compressed ligand files with in gzip/bzip2 format, resulting in a file footprint as low as just one eighth of the raw size using gzip (Figure \ref{idock:Compression}). This new functionality turns out to be extremely handy given an enormous amount of ligands to dock.

Both idock and Vina support 16 common chemical elements, which are H (hydrogen), C (carbon), N (nitrogen), O (oxygen), F (fluorine), Mg (magnesium), P (phosphorus), S (sulfur), Cl (chlorine), Ca (calcium), Mn (manganese), Fe (iron), Zn (zinc), Se (selenium), Br (bromine), and I (iodine). idock adds 9 additional elements, which are Na (sodium), K (potassium), Co (cobalt), Ni (nickel), Cu (copper), Sr (strontium), Cd (cadmium), Hg (mercury), and As (arsenic). Hence idock supports as many as 25 chemical elements, covering the majority of ligand atom types (Figure \ref{idock:ChemicalElements}). % Untested feature

idock outputs verbose information to docked PDBQT files, including total free energy normalized by torsional degree of freedom (Equation \eqref{idock:FlexibilityPenalty}), total free energy, inter-ligand free energy, intra-ligand free energy, putative hydrogen bonds, and per-atom inter-ligand free energy (Figure \ref{idock:OutputPDBQT}). The normalized total free energy is used in ligand ranking. The output of total free energy, inter-ligand free energy and intra-ligand free energy provides an alternative ranking option using derived efficiency indexes \citep{335,336,337}. The per-atom inter-ligand free energy facilitates interaction hotspot determination, and helps improving potency by altering certain chemical moieties while retaining those critical for binding.

idock extracts the above records from docked PDBQT files, sorts them in the ascending order of normalized total free energy, and writes them to a CSV (Comma-Separated Vector) file for subsequent analysis (Figure \ref{idock:OutputCSV}). Users can derive their own efficiency indexes \citep{335,336,337} and re-sort the records for their particular applications.

idock implements our own lightweight thread-safe progress bar, reporting progress every 10\% Monte Carlo tasks per ligand. idock better supports rvalue references and move semantics in C++11 to boost performance. idock flattens the tree-like recursive data structure of ligand as used in AutoDock Vina into simple linear array structure to ensure a high data cache hit rate and easy coding. idock accelerates the assignment of atom types by making use of residue information for receptor and branch information for ligand.

\section{Benchmarks and Results}

idock x86\_64 v1.5 and AutoDock Vina x86 v1.1.2 were evaluated on desktop computers with Intel Core i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz and 4GB DDR3 RAM under Mac OS X 10.7.4 Build 11E53. Arguments to both programs were left as default. By default, both programs output 9 predicted conformations per ligand. The benchmarks include comparison of their redocking performance in terms of predicted conformations, and comparison of their virtual screening performance in terms of execution time, memory usage, predicted free energy, and predicted conformations.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

We have developed idock for protein-ligand docking, inheriting from Vina the accurate scoring function and the efficient optimization algorithm, and meanwhile introducing a fruitful of innovations in C++ implementations, data structures, numerical models, and Monte Carlo algorithms. idock implements its own thread pool to maintain a high CPU utilization throughout the entire screening procedure. It intensively utilizes modern C++11 techniques, particularly Rvalue references to avoid frequent reallocations of array data. It flattens Vina's tree-like recursive data structures into simple array structures to guarantee a high data cache hit rate. It automatically detects and deactivates inactive torsions and thus reduces the dimension of variables to optimize.

In Vina's official forum, there are tremendous requests for the support for virtual screening. The development of idock perfectly complements Vina. idock has built-in support for virtual screening. It searches for ligands in a user-specified folder and docks them one by one. It reuses threads and grid maps across multiple ligands. idock has very similar input and output arguments as Vina, so it should be quite easy for existing Vina users to transit to idock. Vina supports flexible receptor docking by rotating flexible side-chains. However, at the moment we have not yet implemented flexible receptor docking, which has been proved helpful in some cases \citep{1084}, so users who need this kind of docking should refer to Vina.

We performed large-scale protein-ligand docking with idock, and noticed that the high-rank ligands were usually those comparatively rigid ligands with few active torsions. Such phenomenon can be explained by equation \eqref{idock:FlexibilityPenalty}. Fewer active torsions imply smaller denominator, or larger value in other words. We are considering replacing free energy by some ligand efficiency indexes \citep{335,336,337} for ranking.

idock supports Linux and Windows, and can be easily extended to support Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris. Accompanying with idock are 13 ready-to-use docking examples, a doxygen file for generating API documentations.

\section{Future works}

The challenges of docking tools \citep{493}: receptor flexibility, water molecules, metals. Another major factor that significantly limits the accuracy of todayâ€™s docking methods is protein flexibility upon ligand binding. The presence of water molecules critical to the binding of ligands adds another dimension to the docking problem.

The protein is assumed rigid in this study. \citep{1397} investigates the relationship between protein flexibility and binding free energy and present some useful hints for understanding when, and to what extent, flexibility should be considered.

Port idock to CUDA and OpenCL.
GASPRNG \citep{1401} GPU accelerated scalable parallel random number generator library using CUDA

The modern GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) has evolved from a fixed-function graphics pipeline to a programmable parallel processor with extremely high computational throughput and tremendous memory bandwidth at an affordable price. Performance evaluation of hybrid programming patterns for large CPU/GPU heterogeneous clusters has been carried out \citep{1035}. The past five years have seen a fruitful of algorithms for computer-aided drug discovery being ported to the GPU and gaining orders of magnitude of speedup over single threaded CPU counterparts. To name a few, such GPU-accelerated applications include FTMap \citep{722} for binding site mapping, CUDASW++2.0 \citep{189} for protein database search, the leader and the spread algorithms \citep{750} for compound selection, PIPER \citep{723}, PLANTS \citep{779}, parallelized AutoDock \citep{696}, GPUperTrAmber \citep{1270} and a transcription factor-DNA docking program \citep{1267,1266} for molecular docking, SIML \citep{726} and Tanimoto matrix calculation \citep{881} for chemical similarity calculation, OpenMM \citep{373}, MD-GPU \citep{374} and SPFP \citep{1261} for molecular dynamics, PAPER \citep{491} for molecular shape comparison, gWEGA \citep{1388} for molecular superposition and shape comparison, a k-centers algorithm for clustering conformations \citep{1275}, CAMPAIGN \citep{932} for data clustering, and visualization \citep{986}.
