\chapter{istar: Software as a Service}

\citep{1396} The web interface enables binding sites detection, virtual screening hits identification, and drug targets prediction in an interactive manner through a seamless interface to all adapted packages (e.g., Cavity, PocketV.2, PharmMapper, SHAFTS). Several commercially available compound databases for hit identification and a well-annotated pharmacophore database for drug targets prediction were integrated in iDrug as well. The web interface provides tools for real-time molecular building/editing, converting, displaying, and analyzing.
\citep{1396} iDrug requires Java for visualization.
\citep{1425} SwissDock: a protein-small molecule docking web service based on EADock DSS
