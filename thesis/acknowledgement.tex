I believe I would never have completed this thesis and gotten this far without the years of generous support of my supervisors, Prof. Kwong-Sak Leung and Prof. Man-Hon Wong, and I am sure that a simple thank you will never be enough to convey my gratitude for their criticisms and praises along the way. They provided gracious and vital help and a great deal of crucial feedback and substance in writing the thesis. They treated me with considerable respect and understanding and made me feel like a worthy researcher.

I feel extremely lucky and humbled to have had the opportunity to learn from such an impressive and supportive research group. The group members, Prof. Kwong-Sak Leung, Prof. Man-Hon Wong, Prof. Kin-Hong Lee, Prof. Kevin Yuk-Lap Yip, Prof. Cyrus Tak-Ming Chan, Prof. Mary Miu-Yee Waye, Prof. Marie Chia-Mi Lin, Prof. Hsiang-Fu Kung, Shaoke Lou, David Chi-Fai Lam, Peter Leung-Yau Lo, Kent Kin-Cheung Ling, Ka-Cheong Lam, Xihao Hu, Dun Ho, Kai Yuen Tso, Ho Yin Szeto, Kwok Kit Tong, Danny Kit Sang Yip, Kwan Yau Cheung, and Po Yuen Wong, have inspired me in their own way to love and pursue my academic desires. They have all taught me to value and enjoy my education by modeling excellence in their teaching, scholarship, and innovation.

I would also like to thank my father Qiteng Li who have made incredible and selfless sacrifices for me over years that I might someday have this privilege.
