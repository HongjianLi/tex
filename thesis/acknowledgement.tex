I believe I would never have completed this thesis and gotten this far without the years of generous support of my supervisors, Prof. Kwong-Sak Leung and Prof. Man-Hon Wong. I am sure that a simple thank you will never be enough to convey my gratitude for their praises and criticisms along the way. They treated me with considerable respect and understanding and made me feel like a worthy researcher.

I feel extremely lucky and humbled to have had the opportunity to learn from an impressive and supportive research group. The group members, Prof. Kwong-Sak Leung, Prof. Man-Hon Wong, Prof. Kin-Hong Lee, Prof. Kevin Yuk-Lap Yip, Prof. Cyrus Tak-Ming Chan, Prof. Marie Chia-Mi Lin, Prof, Shaoke Lou, David Chi-Fai Lam, Peter Leung-Yau Lo, Xihao Hu and Ho Yin Szeto, have inspired me in their own way to love and pursue my academic desires. They have all taught me to value and enjoy my education by modeling excellence in their teaching, scholarship, and innovation.

I would also like to thank my father Qiteng Li who have made incredible and selfless sacrifices for me over years that I might someday have this privilege.
